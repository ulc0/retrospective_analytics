CUI: C0524684, Name: pentosan polysulphate sodium
Definition: The sodium salt of a semisynthetic heparin-like glucosaminoglycan. Although its mechanism of action is unknown, pentosan polysulfate may act as a buffer to control cell permeability by preventing irritating solutes from reaching cells coated with it. Administered orally, excreted pentosan polysulfate adheres to the urinary bladder wall, preventing irritants from entering bladder cells and the development or progression of interstitial cystitis (IC), a complication of some chemotherapies. This agent also exhibits anticoagulant and fibrinolytic properties. In addition, pentosan polysulfate may block endothelial P-selectin and increase microvascular blood flow in sickle cell disease.

If you have symptoms, they may include fever, fatigue, nausea, headache, flu-like symptoms, stiff neck and back, and pain in the limbs. A few people will become paralyzed. There is no treatment to reverse the paralysis of polio. </p> <p>Some people who've had polio develop post-polio syndrome (PPS) years later. Symptoms include tiredness, new muscle weakness, and muscle and joint pain.
